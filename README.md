## Compiling
compiling can be done with the command "make all"

## Executing
Once the binary has been compiled the program can be executed as 
```
./project1 FILEPATH
```

The program has already a set of files to run as an input if you use the command 

```
make run
```

this set of files will be used and the output will be presented in the terminal.
